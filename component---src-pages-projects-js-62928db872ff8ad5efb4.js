The team designs and builds a robot to compete in the NASA Robotic Mining Competition (RMC) at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The competition drives progress for new and unique rover designs to accomplish complex tasks. The goal of the competition is to efficiently mine and deposit as much icy regolith as possible. More points are scored for more regolith mined in the time limit, less energy used, more autonomy used, better dust protection, and a lighter robot. My work on the robot was redesigning and building the mining and depositing apparatus as well as doing scientific outreach in the community around UNH to get more people interested in STEM fields. This was a fun project and the team worked together very well and built a pretty good robot. The robot still had some difficulties at competition but it gets better each year! I am still an active member of this team although my capacity is now as graduate student advisor.
